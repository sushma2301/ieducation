<p class="sectiontag text-big">Transforming education in India</p>
<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and
        adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list.For this, the first step is reducing the burden on
        kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and
        should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of
        tomorrow.I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might
        turn out to be too late.Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.</p>
